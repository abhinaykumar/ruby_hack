1. change the permission of the file
using "chmod 755 fileName.any"
::After this step you will be able to run file using "./fileName.any"

2. chnage "fileName.any" to "fileName"

3. check whether you have /usr/local/bin directory or not.
if not then make one "mkdir -p /usr/local/bin"

4. After creating this dir /usr/local/bin, push
a $PATH of  your "fileName" so that bash can look
for that using this dir /usr/local/bin
using command:: "ln -s $PWD/fileName /usr/local/bin" 

5. then try running by simply typing the
file name "fileName".
